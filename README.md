===============================================================
trinity-gtk-theme is a GTK-2.0/3.0 theme for GTK+ toolkit, based on
the @jschwentker's, @ro1ri's and @elbullazul's trinity themes.

This distribution is a fork of Christian Medel's (@elbullazul) Trinity
as of commit c58796d (Thu Aug 15 2019).  Unnecessary Azurra Framework
files have been removed.  Theme was modified for thin scrollbars.
Colorscheme have been modified both in css and png images.  Added
generation of gresource file and index.theme.
